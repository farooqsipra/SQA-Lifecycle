**Step-by-Step Description**

**1. Requirements Analysis**

Understand business and technical requirements

Identify testable conditions

Communicate ambiguities with stakeholders

**2. Test Planning**

Define scope, approach, and resources

Create a detailed test plan

Decide tools, techniques, and test deliverables

**3. Test Case Design**

Design test cases from requirements

Include positive, negative, boundary, and edge test scenarios

Review and update as necessary

**4. Test Environment Setup**

Configure hardware and software

Prepare test data

Set up tools and ensure accessibility

**5. Test Execution**

Run manual or automated test cases

Record actual results

Log any deviations or bugs found

**6. Defect Reporting & Tracking**

Use a defect tracking system (e.g., JIRA)

Log defects with details (steps to reproduce, severity, screenshots)

Track defects until closure

**SQA 7. Test Closure**

Confirm all planned testing is complete

Document results and metrics

Hold a test closure meeting

**8. Continuous Improvement**

Review testing process for future enhancements

Update SOPs, templates, and learnings

Implement feedback into next cycle
